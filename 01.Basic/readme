This is a simple hello project of react
I use npx create-react-app basic --> command for creating first project
then
I have created second project using vite
eg--> npm create vite@latest --instally created
write project name i have written vitebasic
select React
select Javascript
done
now npm install
npm run dev
Local: http://localhost:5173/
and used this project too
By using vite project is created very faster than normal creation
